Nodi, the default character, is shaped like the canvas node it is named after: a rounded card with an `--accent` cap across the top and round eyes. Ergo has a round head with an `--accent-2` antenna and taller oval eyes. Both bodies are filled with an opaque `--surface` and outlined in `--border-strong`, with two `--text-strong` eyes and four `--text-muted` limbs drawn behind the body, so only the parts that stick out show. Every color is a theme token, so both characters read in all eight themes. The mascot floats, blinks and swings its arms, and all of that motion stops under reduced motion.',
